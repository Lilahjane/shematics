CCP credit.That's already on your transcript (Database Admin, Programming)\n\nb.) Articulated credit.\n That's not on your transcript unless you have already taken a CCP \nclass. You can also attend a class at COTC, establish a transcript, and \nthen the credit can be transferred. If you took a CCP class, you're fine. If not, then you have to take a COTC class to get this credit.
