        "Title": "FITT Principle",
        "Description": "FITT Principle\nRead the Article, Watch the Video Below, then Answer the Questions\n\n\u00a0\nThe FITT principle is a fun acronym that helps everyone, from students to personal trainers, understand and evaluate workout programs.\nF \u2013 Frequency \u2013 how often will you exercise?\nI \u2013 Intensity \u2013 how hard do you work during your exercise?\nT \u2013 Time \u2013 how long do you exercise during each session?\nT \u2013 Type of exercise \u2013 what types of workouts will be a part of your workout program?\n\u00a0\nUsing the FITT principle, an individual can map a workout plan. For example, Sarah wants to run a 5K. Without FITT, Sarah might just go for occasional runs without a plan. But with FITT, she maps out a plan to balance longer, low intensity runs with shorter, high intensity runs. And because Sarah enjoys resistance training, she also plans to lift free weights twice a week as part of her training. Using the FITT principle, Sarah can map out her frequency, intensity, time, and types of exercise to prepare her for her 5K while still weight lifting.\n\u00a0\nLet\u2019s look at another example. Kevin is a high school football player planning his summer training schedule. Kevin knows that he needs to prepare for the various demands of the high school football season. Using the FITT principle, he maps out a 5-day training schedule focusing on weight lifting 3 days a week and includes speed, agility, and conditioning for the other 2 days. With a high-level plan, Kevin can find a program that will achieve his different goals.\nNotice that there is no one size fits all approach to FITT. Each individual comes to FITT with different experiences, goals, and access (equipment and space).\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe FITT principle is an important concept in our health and wellness plan, as it provides a framework for effective exercise programs. But it is important to note the FITT principle doesn\u2019t mean we have to jump right to creating their own workout plans. Instead, individuals can use FITT to start labeling and understanding the different types of workouts they are doing.\nThis can be especially helpful for students who often look for the context and the \u201cwhy\u201d behind what they are doing in physical education or throughout their daily lives. By using the FITT formula, students can have ownership in their physical activity and become more engaged with fitness.\nIn addition, the FITT principle can be applied to any fitness level. When first time fitness goers start out, they can be tempted to compare to their peers. But FITT allows students to create fitness goals (see more on SMART Goals here) relative to their current fitness level.\nAnd as students progress through physical education, they will, in time, be able to take small steps to create their own training sessions or workout plans with the help of the FITT principle. Again, this doesn\u2019t have to happen immediately, but FITT provides an excellent foundation for success.\u00a0\n\u00a0You might find yourself in a position where you aren\u2019t deciding your fitness workout and plan (yet). It could be dictated by a teacher or coach, and that is okay! But you can still use FITT to better understand the types of workouts you are doing. Once you are in complete control of your fitness plan (in school or beyond) you will be ready to understand the different components of a workout plan.\u00a0\nA great first step to using the FITT principle is labeling workouts. In this approach, let\u2019s try to take a look at a week and determine how it relates to FITT. For example, a physical education class meets 5 days a week and has the following schedule:\nMonday \u2013 Strength Training\nTuesday \u2013 Speed, Agility, and Conditioning\nWednesday \u2013 Strength Training\nThursday \u2013 Yoga / Recovery Day\nFriday \u2013 Fun Friday (Boxing, Bootcamp, Dance, Games, Etc)\nFrom here, students can identify and label the different training sessions using FITT (frequency, intensity, time, and type of exercise). Students can do this at a macro level (day by day) or micro level and explore what they did within each training session. Here are some guiding questions that can help:\u00a0\nWas our Monday strength training day low intensity or high intensity? Or a mix of both?\u00a0\nWas our Tuesday session focused on cardiovascular activity or muscular strength?\nDescribe what you did for physical activity on Friday using the FITT principle.\n\nAt some point, you will be in charge of creating your own fitness plan. At a high level, this means you will navigate the frequency, intensity, time, and type of workouts you will do (FITT). But that doesn\u2019t mean you need to go at it alone - at any point in your life!\u00a0\nInstead, FITT can help you determine your high level approach to exercise. From there, you can still fill in the high level picture with different workouts or programs, many of which might be designed or led by someone else. For example, if yoga is part of your FITT principle plan, you still might find a yoga session online or through an in-person class. Notice that while you aren\u2019t creating the yoga workout, you are still using the FITT principle to evaluate how it fits in your overall plan.\u00a0\nMany students can give this a try by picking the types of workouts they do during a week.\u00a0\n\u00a0You can still use the FITT principle to determine what type of workouts or physical activity you want to do, even if it means being a part of a class or group where someone else leads (for example, you go to a local yoga studio or dance class.)\u00a0\nAs you learn more about the FITT principle, you could even start to design your own workout programs. For example, the assignment could state,\u00a0\n\u201cYou are tasked to create a personal fitness plan comprising 150 minutes of physical activity. Use the FITT principle to create a 2-week exercise program incorporating resistance training, aerobic exercise, and rest days.\u201d\nAgain, you can find and adapt workouts you like, but match them to the assignment to achieve the FITT principle concept.\u00a0\nThe FITT principle (frequency, intensity, time, and type of exercise) can help contextualize and deepen understanding of fitness and exercise. As a result, we can create a lasting positive connection with fitness to pursue long-term health and wellness. By using FITT, teachers can equip students with vocabulary of different exercise and training terminology.\nAnd remember, just because you use the FITT principle doesn\u2019t mean you must create and design semester-long workout programs. Even adults look to trained and certified professionals to help do this. But instead, the FITT principle should be seen as a valuable tool to help students put fitness into context and help plan at a HIGH level what they should be doing for physical activity on a regular basis.\u00a0\n\nCopy 1 exercise: FITT Principle\n1.FITT Principle\n\n\n\n\n1) What does the FITT acronym stand for?\n2) How could someone use FITT to plan a week worth of workouts?\n3) How would you compare sprints to a long jog using the Intensity, Time, and Type (ITT) of FITT?\n4) Use the FITT Principle to describe your week of physical activity and exercise",

Also, we are hosting a Senior Summer session on Tuesday August 13th from 8:30-approx. 11:30am to help seniors begin their college application process. Signup through google classroom to attend.\n\nSchedules will become available for viewing on Friday August 16th for your review in ProgressBook and hard copies will be available at Open House. More information to come about Open House.\n\nCCP students taking courses off campus at an institution or online need to forward those CCP schedules to your counselor immediately. Make sure to include the course name, meeting dates and times, and how many college hours each course is. You can email a PDF or a screenshot to your counselor.\n\nIf you have any questions you can call the main office or email your counselor:\n\nPhil Sikorski-\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Last names A-K\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0psikorski@lakewoodlocal.k12.oh.us\nJanessa Maybury-\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Last names L-Z\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 jmaybury@lakewoodlocal.k12.oh.us\n\nHave a great rest of your Summer and we will see you at Open House.\n\nPhil Sikorski\nLakewood HS School Counselor\n",

Each program offers a participant two elective credits in Political Science from Ashland University.\n\nThe Academy invites students to consider the American experiment in self-government as a victory for reason and the human spirit that not only warrants grateful celebration, but also demands serious study.\n\nAshbrook's Academy offerings this summer include:\n\nTelling America's Story\nAbraham Lincoln and the Civil War\nThe Bible and the Human Condition\nThe Supreme Court and the Constitution\nWorld War II\nCapitalism vs. Socialism\nPolitics and Literature\nThe Psychology of Good and Evil\nUtopias and Dystopias in Literature and Film\nCSI: The Science of Crime Scene Investigations.\n\nThe schedule is available on the website, AshbrookAcademy.org.\n\nThe cost for a one-week program (tuition + room and board) is $750 per student, but the Ashbrook Center will provide a $400 referral scholarship to any student who is recommended by an alum, making the student\u2019s final cost only $350.

I am serving as the Recruitment Coordinator for\u00a0MD Camp at The Ohio State University\u00a0this summer. I am writing to share with you an incredible opportunity for high school students interested in the field of medicine. MD Camp, sponsored by the Area Health Education Center at The Ohio State University, is looking for applicants for our 2024 MD Summer Camp cohort!\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMD Camp is a\u00a0three-week summer camp\u00a0designed to inspire students interested in pursuing a career in the health professions, including medicine, biomedical research, and more!\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMD Camp is a great opportunity for\u00a0rising high school sophomores, juniors, and seniors\u00a0who might benefit from the\u00a0intellectual challenge, academic and social development, and networking experience\u00a0that it provides. \u202fIt is an incredible chance for students to get an\u00a0early firsthand look at health careers\u00a0they might want to pursue. Ultimately, MD Camp strives to increase the number of physicians from backgrounds or areas that have been traditionally excluded from healthcare. All students may apply; we encourage students who are considered traditionally underrepresented in medicine and traditionally underserved which can include women and individuals from social-economic and/or educationally disadvantaged backgrounds. Scholarships are available.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn addition, MD Camp Counselors will be hosting two Zoom sessions for students who may have questions about the camp or the application process. These sessions are scheduled for Tuesday, February 20th at 5:30pm and Saturday, March 9th at 11am. Registration is required for attendance, and the registration links are available on our website. Both parents and students are welcome at both sessions, although we encourage students to attend so they can hear about MD Camp firsthand and ask questions they may personally have. I have attached a flyer to this email, and I would greatly appreciate it if you would show this to your class or forward this to students and their families. You can also find more information at our website:\u00a0https://medicine.osu.edu/diversity/initiatives/md-camp\n\u00a0\nCamp will be held in-person, and I\u2019d like to note that we unfortunately cannot provide on-campus housing, so students will need to secure transportation to and from camp each day.\u00a0 We are planning for tuition to cost $325. We encourage everyone who is interested to apply, as we offer a multitude of scholarships.

I am serving as the Recruitment Coordinator for\u00a0MD Camp at The Ohio State University\u00a0this summer. I am writing to share with you an incredible opportunity for high school students interested in the field of medicine. MD Camp, sponsored by the Area Health Education Center at The Ohio State University, is looking for applicants for our 2024 MD Summer Camp cohort!\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMD Camp is a\u00a0three-week summer camp\u00a0designed to inspire students interested in pursuing a career in the health professions, including medicine, biomedical research, and more!\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMD Camp is a great opportunity for\u00a0rising high school sophomores, juniors, and seniors\u00a0who might benefit from the\u00a0intellectual challenge, academic and social development, and networking experience\u00a0that it provides. \u202fIt is an incredible chance for students to get an\u00a0early firsthand look at health careers\u00a0they might want to pursue. Ultimately, MD Camp strives to increase the number of physicians from backgrounds or areas that have been traditionally excluded from healthcare. All students may apply; we encourage students who are considered traditionally underrepresented in medicine and traditionally underserved which can include women and individuals from social-economic and/or educationally disadvantaged backgrounds. Scholarships are available.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn addition, MD Camp Counselors will be hosting two Zoom sessions for students who may have questions about the camp or the application process. These sessions are scheduled for Tuesday, February 20th at 5:30pm and Saturday, March 9th at 11am. Registration is required for attendance, and the registration links are available on our website. Both parents and students are welcome at both sessions, although we encourage students to attend so they can hear about MD Camp firsthand and ask questions they may personally have. I have attached a flyer to this email, and I would greatly appreciate it if you would show this to your class or forward this to students and their families. You can also find more information at our website:\u00a0https://medicine.osu.edu/diversity/initiatives/md-camp\n\u00a0\nCamp will be held in-person, and I\u2019d like to note that we unfortunately cannot provide on-campus housing, so students will need to secure transportation to and from camp each day.\u00a0 We are planning for tuition to cost $325. We encourage everyone who is interested to apply, as we offer a multitude of scholarships. Please reach out to us if the cost of attending camp is a concern, as we are happy to offer help in any way that we can.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe would greatly appreciate it if you would forward these materials to any interested students.\u202f\nWhat:\u00a0MD Camp 2024 at The Ohio State University College of Medicine\u00a0\nWho:\u00a0Rising high school sophomores, juniors, and seniors\u00a0\nWhen:\u00a0June 10, 2024 - \u202fJune 28, 2024\nTime:\u00a0Monday \u2013 Friday from 8:00 AM to 4:30 PM (no camp on Juneteenth)\nCost:\u00a0$325.

The program culminates with a mock trial on July 21 at the Athens County Municipal Court. In the days leading up to the mock trial, alumni and current OHIO pre-law and mock trial students will work in virtual sessions with institute participants, preparing them for roles as prosecutors, witnesses and defense attorneys.\n\nParticipants in this free program will:\nWatch a Supreme Court of Ohio oral argument and meet Justice Melody J. Stewart of the Supreme Court of Ohio.\nVisit the Athens County Court of Common Pleas.\nVisit with non-governmental organizations, such as Southeastern Ohio Legal Services, American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio and others.\nMeet and interact with attorneys and judges.\nLitigate a mock trial in a real courtroom.\n\nFor full consideration, students should\u00a0submit the application, a high school transcript copy and one letter of recommendation by\u00a0.\n\nBecause space in this competitive program is limited, admission preference will be given to high achieving rising high school juniors and seniors from Southeast Ohio. Others will be considered as space is available. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis, so applicants are encouraged to\u00a0apply early.\n\nSelected participants will be responsible for arranging their own transportation to and from Athens, Ohio, for the in-person portion of the program.

It is free!!\n\n\nA recent survey found that 37% of teens say they have poor mental health. This 6-week course aims to curb this mental health crisis by bringing together the best insights from Dr. Laurie Santos\u2019 popular Yale course Psychology and the Good Life. In this course, you will explore what the field of psychology teaches us about how to be happier, how to feel less stressed, and how to thrive in high school and beyond. The lessons along with short weekly \u2018happiness homework\u2019 assignments will ultimately prepare you to put these scientific findings into practice. The ultimate goal is for you to feel better and build healthier habits. Parents, teachers, and other professionals supporting teenagers may also find the course beneficial.",

        "Title": "Why should your students have to wait until college to start honing their craft in poetry, fiction, and nonfiction?\nEvery summer for nearly three decades, talented high school juniors and seniors to-be have been welcomed to Denison University in Granville, Ohio, for the acclaimed\u00a0Reynolds Young Writers Workshop. The workshop is an eight-day residential program that incorporates small creative writing workshops, group sessions with Denison creative writing faculty and notable visiting writers, and much more.\nOnly 48 students get the chance to come to The Hill to participate each June. That means students experience small, intimate writing workshops and one-on-one interactions with people who have made writing their career. It's a great way to connect with a close-knit community of writing teachers, mentors, and peers from around the world.\nNow Accepting Applications!\nThis is your students' chance to work with award-winning authors whose work has appeared in publications like\u00a0,\u00a0, and\u00a0; who have published books; who care deeply about storytelling; and who love to teach.\nThe program runs from\u00a0. Financial assistance is available to families who qualify, and information about the program is online at\u00a0reynolds.denison.edu. Applications must be submitted no later than\u00a0.\nThank you for encouraging your students to consider this opportunity.

        "Title": "Dear Science Day Students, Parents, Members and Teachers:\n\u00a0\nFor more than 45 years, The Ohio Academy of Science has acted as the Ohio Governor's designee for selecting Ohio's delegates to the National Youth Science Camp.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe\u00a02023 National Youth Science Camp\u00a0(NYSCamp) is scheduled to be held from June 19, 2023, to July 12, 2023, with a hybrid model. The first five days are virtual and the remaining days of the camp are in-person at Camp Pocahontas in West Virginia. Two delegates per state will be selected by representatives of their governor\u2019s office to attend the camp. Housing, meals, transportation, and supplies are provided to participants at\u00a0no cost.\u00a0Selected delegates\u00a0must\u00a0commit to attending the full camp including\u00a0both\u00a0the virtual\u00a0and\u00a0in-person portions of camp.\n\u00a0\nDelegates will be expected to commit to attending the full NYSCamp and fill out delegate paperwork by April 1, 2023, or their spot may be given to an alternate from their state or another state. Since selection to attend camp is a very competitive process with only two delegates guaranteed a spot from each state or nation, we expect NYSCamp delegates to fully participate in both the virtual and in-person portions of camp. For virtual camp days, we expect delegates to at least attend the nightly keynote lecture and evening cabin meeting activities.\n\u00a0\nEligibility Requirements\nGraduates from high school between 1 July 2022 and 30 June 2024.\nDocumented superior academic proficiency, including recognition in STEAM.\nRecognition for notable achievements in STEAM program areas.\nSkills and achievements outside of STEAM and academia.\nMust demonstrate a curiosity and an eagerness to explore new topics.\nMust intend to pursue higher education and a career in a STEAM-related field.\nMust be willing and able to participate daily for the entire duration of the NYSCamp program.\nMust be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 with at least one booster before attending the in person portion of camp. Official documentation of vaccination status will be required to be submitted if selected to attend the NYSCamp.\n\u00a0\ufeffThe deadline to submit applications is 6:00 PM EST on February 28, 2023.\u00a0To apply, please visit:\u00a02023 NYSCamp \u2013 National Youth Science Academy\n\u00a0\nA centerpiece and highlight of the NYSCamp is the\u00a0keynote lecture series\u00a0presented at 8PM EDT each weeknight during the virtual portion of camp and twice a day on most days of the in-person camp. These world-class lectures are presented by prestigious and up-and-coming STEM professionals who are making a difference in their fields of study and changing the world for good. Immediately after each lecture, delegates interested in learning more will have the opportunity to join the lecturer for a 30-minute interactive\u00a0Q&A session.\u00a0Multiple informal\u00a0evening hangouts\u00a0will be offered at 9:30 PM EDT each weeknight during the virtual portion of the camp. These will be replaced by evening cabin meetings in your assigned cabins during the in-person portion of camp. Throughout the NYSCamp experience, delegates will have opportunities for delegates to engage in meaningful discussions and experiences with delegates, presenters, and staph (intentionally misspelled to connote their infectious enthusiasm).\n\u00a0\nOther programming at camp will allow delegates to delve deeper into STEM topics with experts and knowledgeable enthusiasts in multi-day mini-courses (directed studies) or interactive 60 minute\u00a0seminars, take\u00a0tours\u00a0of facilities like the Green Bank Observatory and National Gallery of Art, learn new\u00a0hobbies and skills, and engage with camp staph* in\u00a0program areas\u00a0that will range from practicing languages, yoga, or mindfulness, playing virtual games, discussing compelling topics, making art or music, or learning outdoor skills.\n\u00a0\nDelegates will also be able to participate in the NYSCamp outdoor program which includes camping, hiking, caving, and mountain biking.\n\u00a0\nThank you and best regards,\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMichael Woytek, CEO\nThe Ohio Academy of Science\n5930 Wilcox Pl., Suite F\nDublin, OH 43016",
